Optimizing Electricity Distribution in the Gaza Strip with Combined Sorted Linked Lists

For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which 
undermined already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 
2017 in the context of disputes between the de facto authorities in Gaza and the West Bank-based 
Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely affected the availability of 
essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and undermined Gazaâ€™s fragile 
economy, particularly the manufacturing and agriculture sectors.
The data presented in the attached file (Electricity.csv) is provided to OCHA on a daily basis 
by the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), the official body in charge of electricity 
supply in the Gaza Strip. The variation in electricity demand per day is estimated based on the 
temperatures recorded on that day.

b. A specific electricity statistic for a given month across all days and years 
c. A specific electricity statistic for a given year across all days and months 
d. A total statistic for all data. Note: statistics include at least: total(sum), average, 
maximum, and minimum
